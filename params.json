{"name":"I Saw My Shadow","tagline":"Git Repository for my February 1GAM entry","body":"Welcome to the git repository for my February One Game A Month entry titled \"I Saw My Shadow\". This game is a platformer featuring a fun-loving groundhog and his adventurous shadow. The game is pretty small, and I had to cut a handful of features I wanted to add to allow time to work on other projects.\r\n\r\nThe game is built on top of Noel Berry's Advanced Platforming Engine (APE) for FlashPunk. The groundhog on the title screen is stock art purchased from clipartof.com. The music is from opengameart.org, courtesy of Johann Brodd and Choro Bavario. The sounds are mostly from freesound.org. Please feel free to use the code as you wish. If you do use any of the other assets please give credit where credit is due.\r\n\r\n-Eric Bernier","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
